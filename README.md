## üöÄ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or later
- Apache Maven
- MySQL Server

### 1. Database Setup
1.  Open your MySQL client (e.g., phpMyAdmin, MySQL Workbench).
2.  Create a new database named `pmsdb`:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE pmsdb;
    ```
3.  No need to create tables manually. Hibernate will generate them for you on the first run.

### 2. Configure the Application
1.  Open the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.
2.  Update the database credentials to match your MySQL setup:
    ```properties
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pmsdb
    spring.datasource.username=your_mysql_username
    spring.datasource.password=your_mysql_password
    ```
3.  Set the `ddl-auto` property. For the first run, use `create`:
    ```properties
    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
    ```
    After the first successful run, change this to `update` to preserve your data on subsequent restarts.

### 3. Run the Application
1.  Open a terminal in the root directory of the project.
2.  Run the application using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
3.  The application will be accessible at **http://localhost:8080**.

### 4. Initial Data (Required)
For the application to function, you must have at least one admin. Run the following SQL script to create the default admin:
```sql
INSERT INTO Admin (username, password, email, balance)
VALUES ('superadmin', 'password', 'superadmin@example.com', 0.00);
```
**Note**: Passwords are not hashed in this version. For a production environment, implement Spring Security.

The application uses the following main tables:
- **Admin**: Stores the single administrator's account and balance.
- **AppUser**: Stores customer accounts and their balances.
- **Product**: Contains all product details and is linked to an `Admin`.
- **CartItem**: A temporary table for items in a user's shopping cart.
